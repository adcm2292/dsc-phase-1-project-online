# Creating Movies in 2020

Welcome! In this repo I present my EDA performed looking to answer the question "WHAT TYPE OF FILMS TO CREATE?

In the "notebooks" folder you will find a total of five notebooks containing my work. 

I focused my exploration on the genres, finances and people's preference. Also patterns, over outliers. There's only one Avatar or one Titanic.
